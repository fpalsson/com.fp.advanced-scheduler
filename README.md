# Advanced Scheduler

An advanced scheduler for weekly and monthly (comming) schedules with fixed time or solar (comming) events.

Currently with no well working Settings GUI. Change settings in examplesettings.json and paste it on the settings webpage. A better UI will come as soon as there is time for implementing it.

Todo:

Ask someone to do formal checks of code, as this is my first ever TypeScript/Javascript adventure.

Create a task in VS Code that transpiles TS automatically and then does "homey app run".

Make sure debugging works.

Add error handling in relevant places.

Adding monthly shedule.

Adding solar events, based on SunEvent app.

Create a HTML GUI for editing settings, instead of just pasting a json file in one place.

LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTING.
