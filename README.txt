An advanced scheduler for weekly and monthly (comming) schedules with fixed time or solar events (sunset, sunrise, dusk, dawn, midday and so on).

The idea is not having to setup LOTS of flows if you have complex rules of when to do things based on a weekly schedule (with possibly diffrent times at different days of week). Simply setup schedules and add triggers (called schedule items) based on time or solar events. Then setup what should happen at every trigger (by setting tag values), and use flows to execute actions. See app community page for more info.
